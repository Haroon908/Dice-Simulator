# Dice-Simulator

In this project, I have used python with tkinter.
tkinter is a library used for GUI in python.
First import that Library and then make a screen by using tkinter.

After that a function is being made in which I have used Label of tkinter.
and then finally when button is clicked , function is called by using "command = function".
